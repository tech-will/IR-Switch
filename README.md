# IR-Switch
A homebrew app for the switch that allows you to view the Switch's IR camera on the right joy-con that is steamed to the switch's screen.

# Features:

• Change the resolution

• Hide the UI

• Switch between greyscale and thermal colour*

• Turn the IR led off

• Detach controllers to use like a mini camera

*The thermal colour mode shows the amount of InfaRed light that is recieved by the InfaRed sensor. It is NOT a thermal camera because the sensor only detects shorter infared wavelengths of around 850-940nm that are emmited by a TV remote for example. It cannot detect heat's wavelength.

# Controls:

• Press left stick to hide/show UI

• Up/Down on D-PAD to switch between thermal/greyscale

• Left/Right on D-PAD to change resolution

• - to turn off IR LED

# Usage:

Download the zip from releases and extract to the root of your switch SD card.
