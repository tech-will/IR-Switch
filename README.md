# IR-Switch
A homebrew app for the switch that allows you to view the Nintendo Switch's IR camera on the right joy-con that is steamed to the Nintendo switch's screen.

# Features:

• Change the resolution

• Hide the UI

• Switch between greyscale and thermal colour*

• Turn on and off the IR led off

• Detach the controllers to use like a mini camera

*The thermal colour mode shows the amount of InfaRed light that is recieved by the InfraRed sensor. It is NOT a thermal camera because the sensor only detects shorter infrared wavelengths of around 850-940nm that are emitted by a TV remote for example. It cannot detect heat's wavelength.

# Controls:

• Press left stick to hide/show UI

• Up/Down on D-PAD to switch between thermal/greyscale

• Left/Right on D-PAD to change resolution

• - to turn off IR LED

Note:

Higher resolution for the IR camera slows down the camera speed while lower resolution speeds up the camera speed.

# Usage:

Download the zip from https://github.com/tech-will/IR-Switch/releases/tag/Final-Release and extract to the root of your switch SD card. 
You can also download it from the homebrew app store at https://hb-app.store/switch/IRSwitch

#Future plans
Might add UI after I finish my other homebrew app.
